Fetch all top-level parent zones from the ParcoRTLSMaint database.

Similar to `/get_parents`, this endpoint retrieves zones with no parent zone (`i_pnt_zn IS NULL`), such as campuses, but returns a simpler structure with only zone ID and name. It is used in scenarios where a minimal representation of top-level zones is needed, such as dropdowns or quick selections in the ParcoRTLS frontend.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with a single key "zones" containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a parent zone with:
        - zone_id (int): The unique zone ID (`i_zn`).
        - name (str): The name of the zone (`x_nm_zn`).
    Example: {"zones": [{"zone_id": 1, "name": "Main Campus"}, ...]}
    If no parent zones are found, returns {"zones": []}.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If an unexpected error occurs during database query execution.

Example Usage:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/get_parent_zones" -H "accept: application/json"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "zones": [
            {"zone_id": 1, "name": "Main Campus"},
            {"zone_id": 2, "name": "West Campus"}
        ]
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - **Zone Selection**: The frontend uses this endpoint to populate a dropdown for selecting a top-level zone when configuring devices, triggers, or sub-zones.
    - **Simplified Hierarchy View**: Unlike `/get_parents`, this endpoint provides a lightweight response for scenarios where only zone IDs and names are needed.

Hint:
    - This endpoint is redundant with `/get_parents` but returns fewer fields; consider consolidating or deprecating one in future iterations to reduce API complexity.
    - For campus-level tag tracking, combine with `/get_zone_vertices/{zone_id}` to check if a tag's coordinates are within a campus boundary.
