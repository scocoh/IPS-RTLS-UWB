Fetch all zones to allow selection as parent zones in the Zone Builder.

This endpoint retrieves a list of all zones from the `zones` table in the `maint` schema,
sorted by zone type and name. It is used in the Zone Builder tool to populate a dropdown or
list of potential parent zones when creating a new zone, supporting the hierarchical structure
of zones in the ParcoRTLS system (e.g., campuses, buildings, floors).

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with a single key "zones" containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
          represents a zone with the following keys:
          - zone_id (int): The unique identifier of the zone (i_zn).
          - name (str): The name of the zone (x_nm_zn).
          - level (int): The zone type (i_typ_zn, e.g., 1 for campus, 2 for building).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/get_parent_zones
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "zones": [
            {"zone_id": 1, "name": "Main Campus", "level": 1},
            {"zone_id": 2, "name": "Building A", "level": 2}
        ]
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - When creating a new zone in the Zone Builder, a user needs to specify a parent zone (e.g.,
      a floor zone under a building). This endpoint provides the list of all zones that can be
      selected as parents, ensuring the zone hierarchy is maintained.

Hint:
    - For campus-level operations (Zone L1), filter the response to include only zones where
      level = 1 to identify top-level campuses.
    - The frontend should handle cases where no zones are returned by prompting the user to create
      a top-level zone first.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if the database pool is unavailable or an unexpected
      error occurs during query execution. The error message includes details for debugging.
