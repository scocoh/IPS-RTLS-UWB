Create a new zone with associated region and vertices.

This endpoint creates a new zone in the `zones` table, an associated region in the `regions` table,
and vertices in the `vertices` table in the `maint` schema. It is a core function of the Zone Builder
tool, allowing users to define new zones (e.g., rooms, floors, campuses) with specific boundaries
and hierarchical relationships in the ParcoRTLS system.

Parameters:
    data (dict, required, body): A JSON object containing the following keys:
        - zone_name (str, required): The name of the zone (x_nm_zn).
        - map_id (int, required): The ID of the associated map (i_map).
        - zone_level (int, required): The zone type (i_typ_zn, e.g., 1 for campus).
        - parent_zone_id (int, optional): The ID of the parent zone (i_pnt_zn), or null for top-level zones.
        - vertices (list, optional): A list of dictionaries, each with:
            - n_x (float): The x-coordinate.
            - n_y (float): The y-coordinate.
            - n_z (float): The z-coordinate (typically 0 for 2D zones).

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with the following keys:
          - zone_id (int): The ID of the newly created zone (i_zn).
          - message (str): A success message ("Zone created successfully").

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/create_zone         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d '{
        "zone_name": "Room 101",
        "map_id": 1,
        "zone_level": 4,
        "parent_zone_id": 2,
        "vertices": [
            {"n_x": 0.0, "n_y": 0.0, "n_z": 0.0},
            {"n_x": 10.0, "n_y": 0.0, "n_z": 0.0},
            {"n_x": 10.0, "n_y": 10.0, "n_z": 0.0}
        ]
    }'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "zone_id": 3,
        "message": "Zone created successfully"
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A facility manager uses the Zone Builder to create a new room zone within a building. They
      specify the room's name, associate it with a floorplan (map_id), set its type as a room
      (zone_level=4), link it to a parent building (parent_zone_id), and define its boundary
      with vertices.

Hint:
    - For campus-level zones (zone_level=1), set parent_zone_id to null to indicate a top-level
      zone. This is useful for checking if tags are within a campus boundary.
    - Validate vertices against the map's bounds (from /get_map_metadata) before submission to
      ensure they are within the map's coordinate system.

Errors:
    - 400 (Bad Request): Raised if required fields (zone_name, map_id, zone_level) are missing or
      if map_id or zone_level are not integers.
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if zone creation fails due to database issues or unexpected
      errors.
