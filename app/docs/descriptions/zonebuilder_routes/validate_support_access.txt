Validate support access with a secret password (hidden endpoint).

This internal endpoint verifies a provided password against a hardcoded secret password to grant
support access. It is not exposed in the Swagger UI and is intended for administrative or support
purposes within the ParcoRTLS system, such as accessing restricted debugging features or
configurations in the Zone Builder tool.

Parameters:
    payload (dict, required, body): A JSON object with the following key:
        - password (str, required): The password to validate against the secret password.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with the following key:
          - status (str): Indicates successful validation ("ok") if the password is correct.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/validate-support-access         -H "Content-Type: application/json"         -d '{"password": "gene"}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "ok"
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A support engineer needs to access restricted debugging tools or configuration settings in the
      Zone Builder to troubleshoot issues with zone or device management. This endpoint validates
      their credentials to unlock these features.

Hint:
    - The secret password is currently hardcoded as "gene". For production environments, consider
      replacing it with a secure, environment-variable-based secret to enhance security.
    - Since this endpoint is hidden (include_in_schema=False), it is not visible in the Swagger UI,
      reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Ensure only authorized personnel know the endpoint URL.

Errors:
    - 403 (Forbidden): Raised if the provided password does not match the secret password.
