Delete a device and its associated assignments from the ParcoRTLS database.

This endpoint removes a device from the `devices` table and its related assignments from the
`deviceassmts` table in the `maint` schema. It is used in the Zone Builder tool to decommission
devices (e.g., UWB tags or anchors) that are no longer in use, ensuring they are removed from the
ParcoRTLS system's tracking data.

Parameters:
    device_id (str, required, path): The unique identifier of the device to delete (x_id_dev).

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with the following key:
          - message (str): A success message indicating the device was deleted
                           ("Device {device_id} deleted successfully").

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/api/delete_device/TAG001
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Device TAG001 deleted successfully"
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A facility manager identifies a faulty UWB tag that needs to be removed from the system. This
      endpoint deletes the tag and its assignments, ensuring it no longer appears in tracking reports
      or zone associations.

Hint:
    - Before deletion, use `/api/get_all_devices` to confirm the device's details and its current
      zone association to avoid accidental removal.
    - For campus-level cleanup, target devices associated with zones where `i_typ_zn=1` to remove
      all tags from a specific campus.

Errors:
    - 404 (Not Found): Raised if the `device_id` does not exist in the `devices` table.
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if the deletion fails due to database connectivity issues
      or other unexpected errors. The error message includes details for debugging.
