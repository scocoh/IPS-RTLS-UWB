Fetch all zone types from the ParcoRTLS database.

This endpoint retrieves a list of zone types from the `tlkzonetypes` table in the `maint` schema.
Zone types define the hierarchical levels of zones (e.g., campus, building, floor) in the
ParcoRTLS system. The endpoint is used by the Zone Builder tool to populate a dropdown or list
of zone types when creating or editing zones.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each representing a zone type with the following keys:
          - zone_level (int): The zone type ID (i_typ_zn, e.g., 1 for campus).
          - zone_name (str): The description of the zone type (x_dsc_zn).
          - api_endpoint (str): The endpoint to create a zone (hardcoded as "/create_zone").

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/get_zone_types
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {"zone_level": 1, "zone_name": "Campus", "api_endpoint": "/create_zone"},
        {"zone_level": 2, "zone_name": "Building", "api_endpoint": "/create_zone"}
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - When creating a new zone in the Zone Builder, a user needs to select the zone type (e.g.,
      campus or floor). This endpoint provides the available zone types to ensure the zone is
      correctly categorized in the hierarchy.

Hint:
    - For campus-level zones, select zone_level = 1. This can be used to check if a tag is on a
      campus by associating devices with zones of this type.
    - The api_endpoint field is currently hardcoded. Future enhancements could make it dynamic
      based on zone type.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if there is a database connection issue or an unexpected
      error occurs during query execution.
