Fetch all zones with additional metadata for trigger demo purposes.

This endpoint retrieves a list of all zones from the `zones` table, including their map ID and
parent zone ID, sorted by zone type and name. It is designed for experimental or demonstration
purposes in the ParcoRTLS system, particularly for testing trigger-related functionalities in the
Zone Builder tool, where additional zone metadata (e.g., map associations) is required.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with a single key "zones" containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
          represents a zone with the following keys:
          - zone_id (int): The unique identifier of the zone (i_zn).
          - name (str): The name of the zone (x_nm_zn).
          - level (int): The zone type (i_typ_zn, e.g., 1 for campus).
          - i_map (int): The map ID associated with the zone (i_map).
          - parent_zone_id (int or None): The ID of the parent zone (i_pnt_zn), or None if top-level.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/get_parent_zones_for_trigger_demo
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "zones": [
            {
                "zone_id": 1,
                "name": "Main Campus",
                "level": 1,
                "i_map": 1,
                "parent_zone_id": null
            },
            {
                "zone_id": 2,
                "name": "Building A",
                "level": 2,
                "i_map": 1,
                "parent_zone_id": 1
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - During a demonstration of trigger functionality, a developer needs to select zones to
      associate with triggers (e.g., entry/exit alerts). This endpoint provides comprehensive zone
      data, including map and hierarchy information, to facilitate testing trigger configurations.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint for trigger-related demos to ensure zones are correctly associated with
      maps. Cross-reference i_map with the /get_map_metadata endpoint for map details.
    - For campus-level checks, filter zones where level = 1 and parent_zone_id is null.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if the database pool is unavailable or an unexpected
      error occurs during query execution. The error message includes details for debugging.
