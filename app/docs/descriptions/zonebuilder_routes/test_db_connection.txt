Test the database connection to the `maint` schema.

This endpoint performs a simple query to verify connectivity to the `maint` schema in the
ParcoRTLS database. It is primarily used for debugging and ensuring the backend can communicate
with the PostgreSQL database, which is critical for all Zone Builder operations.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with the following keys:
          - status (str): Indicates the connection status ("success").
          - result (int): The result of the test query (typically 1).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/test_db_connection
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "result": 1
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A system administrator troubleshooting connectivity issues between the FastAPI backend and
      the PostgreSQL database uses this endpoint to confirm that the database pool is operational
      before deploying new Zone Builder features.

Hint:
    - Run this endpoint after server restarts or configuration changes to verify database
      connectivity.
    - If this endpoint fails, check the DB_CONFIG settings and ensure the PostgreSQL server is
      running at localhost:5432.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if the database pool is unavailable or the test query
      fails. The error message includes details for debugging.
