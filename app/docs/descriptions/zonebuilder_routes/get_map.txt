Fetch the binary image data for a specific map.

This endpoint retrieves the binary image data and format for a map identified by its map_id from
the `maps` table in the `maint` schema. It returns the image as a response, which is used by the
Zone Builder tool to display the map in the React frontend for zone creation or editing.

Parameters:
    map_id (int, required, path): The unique identifier of the map (i_map) to fetch.

Returns:
    Response: A FastAPI Response object containing the binary image data with the appropriate
              media type (e.g., image/png, image/jpeg) based on the map's format (x_format).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/get_map/1 --output map.png
    ```
    Response: Binary image data (saved as map.png in the example).

Use Case:
    - When a user selects a map in the Zone Builder to create or edit a zone, this endpoint
      provides the actual image data to render the map in the UI, allowing the user to visualize
      the floorplan or layout.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint in conjunction with /get_map_data or /get_map_metadata to get the map's
      bounds for proper scaling and alignment in the frontend.
    - Ensure CORS is configured to allow the React frontend (http://192.168.210.226:3000) to
      access the image.

Errors:
    - 404 (Not Found): Raised if no map is found for the provided map_id.
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if there is a database connection issue or an unexpected
      error occurs during query execution.
