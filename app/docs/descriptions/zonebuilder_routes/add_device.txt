Add a new device with an associated zone ID to the ParcoRTLS database.

This endpoint inserts a new device into the `devices` table in the `maint` schema, linking it to a
specific zone for real-time location tracking. It is a critical function in the Zone Builder tool,
enabling the registration of new devices such as UWB tags or anchors within the ParcoRTLS system.
The device is assigned a zone ID to associate it with a specific location (e.g., a room or campus).

Parameters:
    device_id (str, required, form): The unique identifier for the device (x_id_dev).
    device_type (int, required, form): The device type ID (i_typ_dev), referencing a type in the
                                      `tlkdevicetypes` table.
    device_name (str, optional, form): The human-readable name of the device (x_nm_dev).
    n_moe_x (float, optional, form): The x-coordinate margin of error (n_moe_x), representing the
                                     device's initial position.
    n_moe_y (float, optional, form): The y-coordinate margin of error (n_moe_y).
    n_moe_z (float, optional, form): The z-coordinate margin of error (n_moe_z), defaults to 0 for
                                     2D tracking.
    zone_id (int, required, form): The ID of the zone (zone_id) to associate the device with,
                                   referencing the `zones` table.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with the following keys:
          - x_id_dev (str): The ID of the newly created device.
          - message (str): A success message ("Device added successfully").

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/api/add_device         -F "device_id=TAG001"         -F "device_type=1"         -F "device_name=Tag 1"         -F "n_moe_x=10.0"         -F "n_moe_y=20.0"         -F "n_moe_z=0.0"         -F "zone_id=1"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "x_id_dev": "TAG001",
        "message": "Device added successfully"
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A technician deploys a new UWB tag in a hospital room (zone_id corresponding to a room zone).
      This endpoint registers the tag in the ParcoRTLS system, associating it with the room for
      tracking patients or equipment within that space.

Hint:
    - Before submitting, verify that the `zone_id` exists in the `zones` table and that the
      `device_type` is valid in the `tlkdevicetypes` table to avoid database errors.
    - For campus-level tracking, use a `zone_id` corresponding to a zone with `i_typ_zn=1` to
      associate devices with a campus, enabling broad location checks.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if the insertion fails due to database connectivity issues,
      duplicate `device_id`, invalid `zone_id`, or other unexpected errors. The error message
      includes details for debugging.
