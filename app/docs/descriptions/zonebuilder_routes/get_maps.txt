Retrieve a list of all available maps from the ParcoRTLS database.

This endpoint fetches metadata for all maps stored in the `maps` table of the `maint` schema.
It is used by the Zone Builder tool in the ParcoRTLS system to display available maps for
creating or editing zones. Each map is identified by a unique ID and name, which are returned
in a structured JSON response for use in the React frontend.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON object with a single key "maps" containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
          represents a map with the following keys:
          - map_id (int): The unique identifier of the map (i_map).
          - name (str): The name of the map (x_nm_map).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://192.168.210.226:8000/zonebuilder/get_maps
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
        "maps": [
            {"map_id": 1, "name": "Campus A Floorplan"},
            {"map_id": 2, "name": "Building B Layout"}
        ]
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - A facility manager uses the Zone Builder tool to create a new zone (e.g., a room or floor).
      This endpoint provides the list of available maps to select as the base map for the zone,
      ensuring the zone is associated with the correct floorplan or layout.

Hint:
    - To verify if a map is associated with a specific campus (Zone L1), cross-reference the
      returned map_id with the zones table (i_map column) where i_typ_zn = 1.
    - Ensure the frontend handles cases where the map list is empty by displaying a fallback UI.

Errors:
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): Raised if there is a database connection issue or an unexpected
      error occurs during query execution. The error message includes details for debugging.
