Delete a region from the ParcoRTLS system by its ID.

This endpoint removes a region from the `regions` table, including any associated vertices, using the stored procedure `usp_region_delete`. Deleting a region is necessary when reorganizing spatial areas or removing outdated regions. Note that associated vertices are also deleted, as they are linked via the `i_rgn` foreign key.

Parameters:
    region_id (int): Path parameter specifying the ID of the region to delete (i_rgn). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response with the following structure:
        - message (str): A confirmation message indicating success ("Region deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If the region_id does not exist in the `regions` table.
        - 500: If the database operation fails or an unexpected error occurs.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_region/1001"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Region deleted successfully"
    }
    ```

Use Case:
    - **Scenario**: A facility manager needs to remove a region that is no longer relevant, such as a temporary event space in a zone.
    - **Example**: In a warehouse, a region defined for a seasonal storage area is deleted after the season ends.

Hint:
    - Before deleting, verify the region exists using `/get_region_by_id/{region_id}` to avoid unnecessary errors.
    - If the region is associated with a trigger, ensure the trigger is updated or deleted separately using `/delete_trigger/{trigger_id}` to maintain data consistency.
    - Deleting a region will cascade to its vertices, so ensure no critical data is lost.
