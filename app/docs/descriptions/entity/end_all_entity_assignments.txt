End all assignments for a specific entity.

This endpoint marks all assignments (parent or child) for a given entity as ended using the `usp_assign_entity_end_all` stored procedure. It is used to terminate all hierarchical relationships while preserving historical data.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The ID of the entity whose assignments are to be ended (e.g., "EMP123"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("All entity assignments ended successfully for entity").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the assignments cannot be ended.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/end_all_entity_assignments/EMP123"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "All entity assignments ended successfully for entity"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - End all assignments for an employee ("EMP123") who has retired, preserving historical data.
    - Terminate all assignments for an asset before reassigning it.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint instead of `/delete_all_entity_assignments/{entity_id}` if historical data needs to be retained.
    - Verify the `entity_id` exists using `/get_entity_by_id/{entity_id}`.
