Delete all assignments for a specific entity.

This endpoint removes all assignments (parent or child) for a given entity using the `usp_assign_entity_delete_all` stored procedure. It is used to clear all hierarchical relationships for an entity.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The ID of the entity whose assignments are to be deleted (e.g., "EMP123"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("All entity assignments deleted successfully for entity").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the assignments cannot be deleted.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_all_entity_assignments/EMP123"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "All entity assignments deleted successfully for entity"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Clear all assignments for an employee ("EMP123") who has left the organization.
    - Reset assignments for an asset before reassigning it to a new entity.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint cautiously, as it removes all assignments for the entity, which may affect tracking or reporting.
    - Verify the `entity_id` exists using `/get_entity_by_id/{entity_id}` before deletion.
