Retrieve all assignments for a specific reason.

This endpoint fetches all assignments associated with a given reason using the `usp_assign_entity_list_by_reason` stored procedure. It is used to analyze assignments by their purpose.

Args:
    reason_id (int): The ID of the assignment reason (e.g., 1 for "Employment"). Required.
    include_ended (bool, optional): Whether to include ended assignments. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing assignment details.
        - x_id_pnt (str): Parent entity ID.
        - x_id_chd (str): Child entity ID.
        - i_rsn_assmt (int): Assignment reason ID.
        - d_crt (datetime): Creation date.
        - d_end (datetime, optional): End date (null if active).

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If no assignments are found for the reason.
        - 500: If the database operation fails.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/list_entity_assignments_by_reason/1?include_ended=true"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {"x_id_pnt": "DEPT001", "x_id_chd": "EMP123", "i_rsn_assmt": 1, "d_crt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00", "d_end": null}
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - List all assignments with reason "Employment" for HR reporting.
    - Analyze assignments for a specific reason to understand system usage.

Hint:
    - Retrieve valid `reason_id` values from `/list_assignment_reasons` before querying.
    - Use `include_ended=True` for comprehensive analysis.
