Add a new assignment reason to the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint creates a new reason for entity assignments (e.g., "Employment", "Maintenance") using the `usp_assmt_reason_add` stored procedure. Reasons categorize assignments for reporting and analysis.

Args:
    request (AssignmentReasonRequest): The request body containing the reason details.
        - reason (str): The name of the assignment reason (e.g., "Employment"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success and the new reason ID.
        - message (str): Success message ("Assignment reason added successfully").
        - reason_id (int): The ID of the newly created reason.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the reason cannot be added.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/add_assignment_reason"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"reason": "Employment"}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Assignment reason added successfully", "reason_id": 1}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Add a new reason ("Transfer") for employee reassignments within departments.
    - Create a reason ("Maintenance") for assigning assets to service teams.

Hint:
    - Check existing reasons with `/list_assignment_reasons` to avoid duplicating reason names.
    - The returned `reason_id` is used in `/assign_entity` and other assignment endpoints.
