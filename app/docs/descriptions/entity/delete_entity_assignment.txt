Delete a specific entity assignment.

This endpoint removes an entity assignment (e.g., an employee from a department) using the `usp_assign_entity_delete` stored procedure. It is used to dissolve hierarchical relationships.

Args:
    assignment_id (int): The ID of the assignment to delete (e.g., 101). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Entity assignment deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the assignment cannot be deleted.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_entity_assignment/101"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Entity assignment deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove an employee ("EMP123") from a department ("DEPT001") after a transfer.
    - Dissolve an assignment when an asset is reassigned to another entity.

Hint:
    - Verify the `assignment_id` exists using `/list_entity_assignments_by_id/{assignment_id}` before deletion.
    - A return value of 0 from the stored procedure indicates the assignment was already deleted, which is treated as success.
