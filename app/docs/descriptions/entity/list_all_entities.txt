Retrieve a list of all entities in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint fetches all entities (e.g., employees, assets, groups) from the system by invoking the `usp_entity_all` stored procedure. It is useful for generating reports or populating UI elements like dropdowns.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing entity details.
        - x_id_ent (str): Entity ID.
        - i_typ_ent (int): Entity type ID.
        - x_nm_ent (str): Entity name.
        - d_crt (datetime): Creation date.
        - d_udt (datetime): Last update date.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If no entities are found in the system.
        - 500: If the database operation fails.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/list_all_entities"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {"x_id_ent": "EMP123", "i_typ_ent": 1, "x_nm_ent": "John Doe", "d_crt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00", "d_udt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00"},
        {"x_id_ent": "ASSET456", "i_typ_ent": 2, "x_nm_ent": "Medical Device", "d_crt": "2025-04-25T09:00:00", "d_udt": "2025-04-25T09:00:00"}
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - Populate a dropdown in the React frontend to allow users to select an entity for assignment or tracking.
    - Generate a report of all registered entities for auditing purposes.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint sparingly in high-traffic scenarios, as it retrieves all entities. Consider filtering by type or ID for better performance.
