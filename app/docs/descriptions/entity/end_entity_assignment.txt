End a specific entity assignment.

This endpoint marks an entity assignment as ended using the `usp_assign_entity_end` stored procedure. It is used to terminate a hierarchical relationship without deleting it, preserving historical data.

Args:
    request (EntityAssignEndRequest): The request body containing the assignment ID.
        - assignment_id (int): The ID of the assignment to end (e.g., 101). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Entity assignment ended successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the assignment cannot be ended.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/end_entity_assignment"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"assignment_id": 101}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Entity assignment ended successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - End an employee's assignment to a department after they leave the organization.
    - Terminate an asset's assignment to a ward when it is moved to storage.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint to maintain historical records instead of deleting assignments with `/delete_entity_assignment/{assignment_id}`.
    - Verify the `assignment_id` exists using `/list_entity_assignments_by_id/{assignment_id}`.
