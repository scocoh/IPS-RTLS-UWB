Retrieve details of a specific entity by its ID.

This endpoint fetches the details of a single entity (e.g., employee, asset) using the `usp_entity_by_id` stored procedure. It is used to display entity information or verify existence before performing operations like assignments.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The unique identifier of the entity (e.g., "EMP123"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing entity details.
        - x_id_ent (str): Entity ID.
        - i_typ_ent (int): Entity type ID.
        - x_nm_ent (str): Entity name.
        - d_crt (datetime): Creation date.
        - d_udt (datetime): Last update date.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If the entity with the specified ID is not found.
        - 500: If the database operation fails.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/get_entity_by_id/EMP123"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"x_id_ent": "EMP123", "i_typ_ent": 1, "x_nm_ent": "John Doe", "d_crt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00", "d_udt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Display detailed information about an employee ("EMP123") in the React frontend.
    - Verify that an entity exists before assigning it to a device or another entity.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint to prefetch entity data before rendering forms or dashboards to reduce latency.
