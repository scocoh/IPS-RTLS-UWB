Retrieve a list of all assignment reasons in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint fetches all assignment reasons (e.g., "Employment", "Maintenance") using the `usp_assmt_reason_list` stored procedure. It is useful for populating UI elements or validating reason IDs.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing reason details.
        - i_rsn_assmt (int): Reason ID.
        - x_rsn_assmt (str): Reason name.
        - d_crt (datetime): Creation date.
        - d_udt (datetime): Last update date.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If no assignment reasons are found.
        - 500: If the database operation fails.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/list_assignment_reasons"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {"i_rsn_assmt": 1, "x_rsn_assmt": "Employment", "d_crt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00", "d_udt": "2025-04-26T10:00:00"},
        {"i_rsn_assmt": 2, "x_rsn_assmt": "Maintenance", "d_crt": "2025-04-25T09:00:00", "d_udt": "2025-04-25T09:00:00"}
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - Populate a dropdown in the React frontend for selecting reasons when assigning entities.
    - Validate reason IDs before creating or updating assignments.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint to ensure valid `reason_id` values are used in assignment endpoints.
