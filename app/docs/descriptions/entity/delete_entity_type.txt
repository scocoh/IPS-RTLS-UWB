Delete an entity type from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes an entity type using the `usp_entity_type_delete` stored procedure. It is used to remove obsolete or unused entity types.

Args:
    type_id (str): The ID of the entity type to delete (e.g., "1"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Entity type deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the entity type cannot be deleted (e.g., due to existing entities of that type).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_entity_type/1"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Entity type deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove an obsolete entity type ("Temporary Worker") that is no longer needed.
    - Clean up unused entity types during system maintenance.

Hint:
    - Ensure no entities are using the `type_id` (check `/get_entities_by_type/{entity_type}`) before deletion to avoid database constraints.
