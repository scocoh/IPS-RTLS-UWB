Update an existing assignment reason.

This endpoint modifies the name of an assignment reason using the `usp_assmt_reason_edit` stored procedure. It is used to correct or update reason names.

Args:
    reason_id (int): The ID of the reason to update (e.g., 1). Required.
    request (AssignmentReasonRequest): The request body containing the updated reason details.
        - reason (str): The updated name of the reason (e.g., "Permanent Assignment"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Assignment reason edited successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the reason cannot be updated.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT "http://192.168.210.226:8000/edit_assignment_reason?reason_id=1"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"reason": "Permanent Assignment"}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Assignment reason edited successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Rename a reason from "Employment" to "Permanent Assignment" for clarity.
    - Update a reason to better reflect its purpose.

Hint:
    - Verify the `reason_id` exists using `/list_assignment_reasons` before updating.
