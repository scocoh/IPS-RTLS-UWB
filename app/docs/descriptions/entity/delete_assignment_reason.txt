Delete an assignment reason from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes an assignment reason using the `usp_assmt_reason_delete` stored procedure. It is used to remove obsolete or unused reasons.

Args:
    reason_id (int): The ID of the reason to delete (e.g., 1). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Assignment reason deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the reason cannot be deleted (e.g., due to existing assignments).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_assignment_reason/1"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Assignment reason deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove an obsolete reason ("Temporary Assignment") that is no longer needed.
    - Clean up unused reasons during system maintenance.

Hint:
    - Ensure no assignments use the `reason_id` (check `/list_entity_assignments_by_reason/{reason_id}`) before deletion to avoid database constraints.
