Delete an entity from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes an entity (e.g., employee, asset) from the system using the `usp_entity_delete` stored procedure. It is used to decommission entities that are no longer tracked.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The unique identifier of the entity to delete (e.g., "EMP123"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Entity deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the entity cannot be deleted (e.g., due to existing assignments).

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_entity/EMP123"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Entity deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove a retired employee ("EMP123") from the system after they leave the organization.
    - Decommission an obsolete asset from the inventory.

Hint:
    - Ensure all assignments (e.g., device or entity assignments) for the entity are removed using `/delete_all_entity_assignments/{entity_id}` or `/end_all_entity_assignments/{entity_id}` before deletion to avoid database constraints.
