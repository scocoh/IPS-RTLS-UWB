End a specific device assignment.

This endpoint marks a device assignment as ended using the `usp_assign_dev_end` stored procedure. It is used to terminate an assignment without deleting it, preserving historical data.

Args:
    request (AssignDeviceEndRequest): The request body containing the assignment ID.
        - assignment_id (int): The ID of the assignment to end (e.g., 101). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device assignment ended successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/end_device_assignment"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"assignment_id": 101}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device assignment ended successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - End a tag's assignment to a zone when it is reassigned to a new zone.
    - Terminate a beacon's assignment to an entity when it is taken offline.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint to maintain historical records instead of deleting assignments with `/delete_device_assignment/{assignment_id}`.
    - Verify the `assignment_id` exists using `/list_device_assignments_by_device/{device_id}`.
