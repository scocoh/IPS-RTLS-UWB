Check if a device ID exists in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint queries the database using the `usp_device_select_by_id` stored procedure to verify if a device ID is already registered. It is used to prevent duplicate device IDs during device creation.

Args:
    device_id (str): The device ID to check (e.g., "TAG001"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating whether the device ID exists.
        - exists (bool): True if the device ID exists, False otherwise.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If a database or unexpected error occurs during the check.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/check_device_id/TAG001"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"exists": true}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Validate a new device ID in the React frontend before submitting a device creation form.
    - Ensure uniqueness when registering a new tag or beacon in the system.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint before calling `/add_device` to avoid duplicate key errors.
