Remove the end date for a device, restoring it to active status.

This endpoint clears a device's service end date using the `usp_device_remove_end_date` stored procedure. It is used to reactivate a device that was previously marked as out-of-service.

Args:
    device_id (str): The ID of the device to update (e.g., "TAG001"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device end date removed successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/remove_device_end_date/TAG001"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device end date removed successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Reactivate a tag after it is reassigned to a new employee.
    - Restore a beacon to service after maintenance is completed.

Hint:
    - Verify the `device_id` exists and is out-of-service using `/get_out_of_service_devices` before calling this endpoint.
    - This endpoint is equivalent to calling `/set_device_end_date` with a null `end_date`.
