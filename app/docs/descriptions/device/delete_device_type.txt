Delete a device type from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes a device type by its ID using the `usp_device_type_delete` stored procedure. It is used to remove obsolete or unused device types.

Args:
    type_id (int): The ID of the device type to delete (e.g., 1). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device type deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_device_type/1"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device type deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove an obsolete device type ("Temporary Tag") that is no longer needed.
    - Clean up unused device types during system maintenance.

Hint:
    - Ensure no devices are using the `type_id` (check `/get_device_by_type/{device_type}`) before deletion to avoid database constraints.
    - A return value of 0 from the stored procedure indicates the type was already deleted, which is treated as success.
