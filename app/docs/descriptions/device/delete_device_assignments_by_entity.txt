Delete all device assignments for a specific entity.

This endpoint removes all device assignments associated with a given entity (e.g., a zone or person) using the `usp_assign_dev_delete_all_by_ent` stored procedure. It is used to clear assignments when an entity is decommissioned or reassigned.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The ID of the entity whose assignments are to be deleted (e.g., "ZONE001"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device assignments deleted successfully for entity").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_device_assignments_by_entity/ZONE001"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device assignments deleted successfully for entity"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Clear all tag assignments for a zone ("ZONE001") that is being reconfigured.
    - Remove device assignments for a department entity after it is dissolved.

Hint:
    - Verify the `entity_id` exists using `/get_entity_by_id/{entity_id}` (from `entity.py`) before deletion.
    - Use `/end_all_device_assignments` if historical assignment data needs to be preserved.
