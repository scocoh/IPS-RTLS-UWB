Delete a device from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes a device by its ID using the `usp_device_delete` stored procedure. It is used to decommission devices that are no longer in use, such as retired tags or beacons.

Args:
    device_id (str): The ID of the device to delete (e.g., "TAG001"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_device/TAG001"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove a tag ("TAG001") from the system after an employee leaves the organization.
    - Decommission a beacon that is no longer operational.

Hint:
    - Ensure all assignments for the device are removed using `/delete_all_device_assignments` or `/end_all_device_assignments` before deletion to avoid database constraints.
    - A return value of 0 from the stored procedure indicates the device was already deleted, which is treated as success.
