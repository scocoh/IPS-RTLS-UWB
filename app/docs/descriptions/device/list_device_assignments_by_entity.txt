Retrieve all device assignments for a specific entity.

This endpoint fetches assignments where the specified entity (e.g., a zone or person) is associated with devices, using the `usp_assign_dev_list_by_entity` stored procedure. It is used to view all devices linked to an entity.

Args:
    entity_id (str): The ID of the entity to filter by (e.g., "ZONE001"). Required.
    include_ended (bool, optional): Whether to include ended assignments. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing assignment details.
        - i_asn_dev (int): Assignment ID.
        - x_id_dev (str): Device ID.
        - x_id_ent (str): Entity ID.
        - i_rsn (int): Assignment reason ID.
        - d_bgn (datetime): Assignment start date.
        - d_end (datetime or None): Assignment end date (null if active).

Raises:
    None: Returns an empty list if no assignments are found or if an error occurs, preventing frontend crashes.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/list_device_assignments_by_entity/ZONE001?include_ended=true"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "i_asn_dev": 101,
            "x_id_dev": "TAG001",
            "x_id_ent": "ZONE001",
            "i_rsn": 1,
            "d_bgn": "2025-04-26T10:00:00",
            "d_end": null
        }
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - List all tags assigned to a zone ("ZONE001") in the React frontend for location tracking.
    - View all beacons assigned to a department entity for maintenance planning.

Hint:
    - Verify the `entity_id` exists using `/get_entity_by_id/{entity_id}` (from `entity.py`) before querying.
    - The empty list return on error aligns with version 0.1.38 changes to improve frontend compatibility.
