Update an existing device assignment.

This endpoint modifies a device assignment (e.g., changing the device, entity, or reason) using the `usp_assign_dev_edit` stored procedure. It is used to update assignment details when reassigning devices or correcting errors.

Args:
    request (AssignDeviceEditRequest): The request body containing updated assignment details.
        - assignment_id (int): The ID of the assignment to update (e.g., 101). Required.
        - device_id (str): The updated device ID (e.g., "TAG001"). Required.
        - entity_id (str): The updated entity ID (e.g., "ZONE001"). Required.
        - reason_id (int): The updated reason ID (e.g., 1 for "Location Tracking"). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device assignment edited successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT "http://192.168.210.226:8000/edit_device_assignment"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"assignment_id": 101, "device_id": "TAG001", "entity_id": "ZONE002", "reason_id": 1}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device assignment edited successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Reassign a tag from one zone ("ZONE001") to another ("ZONE002") in a Zone L1 campus.
    - Update the reason for a beacon's assignment after a change in its purpose.

Hint:
    - Verify the `assignment_id` exists using `/list_device_assignments_by_device/{device_id}` before updating.
    - Ensure `device_id`, `entity_id`, and `reason_id` are valid using appropriate endpoints (e.g., `/get_device_by_id/{device_id}`, `/get_entity_by_id/{entity_id}`, `/list_assignment_reasons`).
