Delete a specific device assignment.

This endpoint removes a device assignment (e.g., a tag's association with a zone) using the `usp_assign_dev_delete` stored procedure. It is used to dissolve assignments when they are no longer needed.

Args:
    assignment_id (int): The ID of the assignment to delete (e.g., 101). Required.

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device assignment deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_device_assignment/101"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device assignment deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Remove a tag's assignment to a zone after it is reassigned to a new zone.
    - Dissolve a beacon's assignment to an entity after it is decommissioned.

Hint:
    - Verify the `assignment_id` exists using `/list_device_assignments_by_device/{device_id}` before deletion.
    - The stored procedure may update the assignment's end date rather than deleting it, depending on implementation (see version 0.1.36 changelog).
