End all device assignments in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint marks all device assignments as ended using the `usp_assign_dev_end_all` stored procedure. It is used to terminate all device-entity associations while preserving historical data, typically during system reconfiguration.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("All device assignments ended successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/end_all_device_assignments"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "All device assignments ended successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - End all tag assignments during a system-wide reset while retaining historical data.
    - Terminate all beacon assignments before reconfiguring zone associations.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint instead of `/delete_all_device_assignments` if historical data needs to be retained.
    - Ensure all affected devices are reassigned as needed after calling this endpoint.
