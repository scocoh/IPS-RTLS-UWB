Set or update the end date for a device, marking it as out-of-service.

This endpoint updates a device's service end date using the `usp_device_set_end_date` stored procedure. It is used to indicate that a device is no longer operational, such as when a tag is retired or a beacon is taken offline for maintenance.

Args:
    request (DeviceEndDateRequest): The request body containing device details.
        - device_id (str): The ID of the device to update (e.g., "TAG001"). Required.
        - end_date (datetime or None): The service end date in ISO format (e.g., "2025-12-31T00:00:00"). Optional, defaults to None (clears end date).

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("Device end date updated successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/set_device_end_date"              -H "Content-Type: application/json"              -d '{"device_id": "TAG001", "end_date": "2025-12-31T00:00:00"}'
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Device end date updated successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Mark a tag as out-of-service after an employee leaves the organization.
    - Set an end date for a beacon scheduled for maintenance.

Hint:
    - Verify the `device_id` exists using `/get_device_by_id/{device_id}` before updating.
    - Setting `end_date` to null via this endpoint or using `/remove_device_end_date` can restore a device to active status.
