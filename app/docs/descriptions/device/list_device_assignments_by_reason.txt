Retrieve all device assignments for a specific reason.

This endpoint fetches assignments associated with a given reason using the `usp_assign_dev_list_by_reason` stored procedure. It is used to analyze assignments by their purpose, such as tracking or maintenance.

Args:
    reason_id (int): The ID of the assignment reason (e.g., 1 for "Location Tracking"). Required.
    include_ended (bool, optional): Whether to include ended assignments. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing assignment details.
        - i_asn_dev (int): Assignment ID.
        - x_id_dev (str): Device ID.
        - x_id_ent (str): Entity ID.
        - i_rsn (int): Assignment reason ID.
        - d_bgn (datetime): Assignment start date.
        - d_end (datetime or None): Assignment end date (null if active).

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If no assignments are found for the reason.
        - 500: If a database error occurs.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/list_device_assignments_by_reason/1?include_ended=true"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "i_asn_dev": 101,
            "x_id_dev": "TAG001",
            "x_id_ent": "ZONE001",
            "i_rsn": 1,
            "d_bgn": "2025-04-26T10:00:00",
            "d_end": null
        }
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    - List all assignments with reason "Location Tracking" for operational reporting.
    - Analyze assignments for a specific reason to understand device usage patterns.

Hint:
    - Retrieve valid `reason_id` values from `/list_assignment_reasons` (from `entity.py`) before querying.
    - Use `include_ended=True` for comprehensive historical analysis.
