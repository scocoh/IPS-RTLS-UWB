Delete all device assignments in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes all device assignments using the `usp_assign_dev_delete_all` stored procedure. It is used to reset all device-entity associations, typically during major system maintenance or reconfiguration.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    dict: A JSON response indicating success.
        - message (str): Success message ("All device assignments deleted successfully").

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 500: If the database operation fails or the stored procedure returns an unexpected result.

Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_all_device_assignments"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {"message": "All device assignments deleted successfully"}
    ```

Use Case:
    - Clear all device assignments during a system-wide reset or migration.
    - Remove all tag-zone associations before reconfiguring a campus's zone structure.

Hint:
    - Use this endpoint cautiously, as it affects all devices and may disrupt tracking operations.
    - Consider using `/end_all_device_assignments` to preserve historical data instead of deleting assignments.
