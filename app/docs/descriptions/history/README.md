# History External Descriptions

External description files for `history.py` endpoints.

## Conversion Results

- **Original file size:** Large with verbose docstrings
- **Converted file size:** Dramatically reduced
- **Swagger UI:** Fully functional with external descriptions
- **Total endpoints:** 3

## File Structure

Each endpoint has its description in a separate `.txt` file:

- `get_recent_device_positions.txt` - GET /get_recent_device_positions/{device_id}
- `insert_position.txt` - POST /insert_position
- `get_history_by_device.txt` - GET /get_history_by_device/{device_id}


## Usage

The `load_description()` function in `history.py` loads these files:

```python
@router.post(
    "/endpoint_path",
    summary="Brief summary",
    description=load_description("function_name"),
    tags=["triggers"]
)
```

## Benefits

- ✅ **Reduced file size:** Much easier to work with in editors and AI tools
- ✅ **Maintained functionality:** Swagger UI shows full descriptions
- ✅ **External management:** Descriptions can be edited separately
- ✅ **Version control:** Code changes don't mix with documentation changes
