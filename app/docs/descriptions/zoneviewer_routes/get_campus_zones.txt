Retrieve all campus zones with their hierarchical structure.

**Description**:
This endpoint fetches all zones from the ParcoRTLS system, organized hierarchically with campuses (zone_type=1)
at the root and their child zones nested accordingly. It is used in the Zone Viewer to display the campus
hierarchy for navigation and management. The response includes zone details like ID, name, type, parent zone,
and map ID, with child zones nested under their parents.

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- JSON object with a single key `campuses`, containing a list of campus objects. Each campus object has:
  - `zone_id` (int): Unique identifier of the zone.
  - `zone_name` (str): Name of the zone.
  - `zone_type` (int): Type of zone (1 for campus, 2 for building, etc.).
  - `parent_zone_id` (int or null): ID of the parent zone, null for campuses.
  - `map_id` (int or null): ID of the associated map.
  - `children` (list): List of child zone objects with the same structure.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/get_campus_zones" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "campuses": [
    {
      "zone_id": 1,
      "zone_name": "Main Campus",
      "zone_type": 1,
      "parent_zone_id": null,
      "map_id": 101,
      "children": [
        {
          "zone_id": 2,
          "zone_name": "Building A",
          "zone_type": 2,
          "parent_zone_id": 1,
          "map_id": 102,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: A facility manager needs to view all campuses and their buildings in the ParcoRTLS Zone Viewer.
- **Action**: The frontend React app calls this endpoint to populate the zone navigation tree, allowing the manager
  to select a campus and drill down to specific buildings or floors.
- **Outcome**: The hierarchical structure enables intuitive navigation and management of zones.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Raised if no zones are found in the database (`HTTPException`, detail="No zones found").
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- This endpoint is ideal for initializing the Zone Viewer UI. To check if a tag is within a campus (e.g., for Zone L1),
  combine this with vertex data from `/get_vertices_for_campus/{campus_id}` to perform spatial queries.
