Delete a zone and all its progeny recursively.

**Description**:
This endpoint deletes a zone and all its child zones (progeny), along with associated regions and vertices.
It is used in the Zone Editor to remove entire zone hierarchies, such as when decommissioning a campus or building.

**Parameters**:
- `zone_id` (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the zone to delete.

**Returns**:
- JSON object with a single key `message` (str): Confirmation message indicating the zone and its progeny were deleted.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/delete_zone_recursive/1" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Deleted zone 1 and its progeny successfully"
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: A facility manager needs to remove an obsolete campus from the ParcoRTLS system.
- **Action**: The frontend calls this endpoint to delete the campus and all its zones.
- **Outcome**: The database is updated, and the campus is removed from the system.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Raised if the `zone_id` does not exist (`HTTPException`, detail="Zone {zone_id} not found").
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- Use with caution, as this endpoint permanently deletes zones and their data.
- Ensure no active tags or entities are associated with the zones before deletion.
