Retrieve all zones under a specific campus, including hierarchy.

**Description**:
This endpoint fetches all zones under a given campus (identified by `campus_id`), including their hierarchical
structure (parent-child relationships). It is used in the ParcoRTLS Zone Viewer to display all zones within a
campus, such as buildings, floors, or rooms.

**Parameters**:
- `campus_id` (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the campus.

**Returns**:
- JSON object with a single key `zones`, containing a list of zone objects. Each zone object has:
  - `zone_id` (int): Unique identifier of the zone.
  - `zone_name` (str): Name of the zone.
  - `zone_type` (int): Type of zone (e.g., 2 for building, 3 for floor).
  - `parent_zone_id` (int or null): ID of the parent zone.
  - `map_id` (int or null): ID of the associated map.
  - `children` (list): List of child zone objects with the same structure.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/get_all_zones_for_campus/1" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "zones": [
    {
      "zone_id": 1,
      "zone_name": "Main Campus",
      "zone_type": 1,
      "parent_zone_id": null,
      "map_id": 101,
      "children": [
        {
          "zone_id": 2,
          "zone_name": "Building A",
          "zone_type": 2,
          "parent_zone_id": 1,
          "map_id": 102,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: A security team needs to manage zones within a campus to track assets.
- **Action**: The frontend calls this endpoint to display all zones under the campus in a tree view.
- **Outcome**: The team can navigate and manage zones efficiently.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Not explicitly raised, but an empty `zones` list is returned if no zones are found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- Use this endpoint to populate a zone management interface for a specific campus.
- Combine with `/get_vertices_for_campus/{campus_id}` to get spatial data for zones.
