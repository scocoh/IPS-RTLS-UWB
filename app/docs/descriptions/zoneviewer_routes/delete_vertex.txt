Delete a specific vertex by ID.

**Description**:
This endpoint removes a vertex from the ParcoRTLS system, used in the Zone Editor to delete a point from a
zone’s polygon shape.

**Parameters**:
- `vertex_id` (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the vertex to delete.

**Returns**:
- JSON object with:
  - `message` (str): Confirmation message ("Vertex deleted successfully").
  - `vertex_id` (int): ID of the deleted vertex.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/delete_vertex/1001" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Vertex deleted successfully",
  "vertex_id": 1001
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: A user removes a vertex from a zone’s polygon to simplify its shape.
- **Action**: The frontend calls this endpoint to delete the vertex.
- **Outcome**: The zone’s polygon is updated in the database.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Raised if the `vertex_id` does not exist (`HTTPException`, detail="Vertex {vertex_id} not found").
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- Deleting a vertex may affect the polygon’s shape. Ensure the remaining vertices maintain a valid polygon.
- Use with `/get_vertices_for_campus/{campus_id}` to refresh the zone’s vertex data after deletion.
