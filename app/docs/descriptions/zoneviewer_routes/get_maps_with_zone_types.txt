Fetch unique maps with their associated zone types, sorted by hierarchy.

**Description**:
This endpoint retrieves a list of unique maps, each associated with the highest-priority zone type (based on a
predefined hierarchy). It is used in the ParcoRTLS system to provide a summary of maps and their primary zone
types for selection in the Zone Viewer or for reporting purposes.

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- JSON object with a single key `maps`, containing a list of map objects. Each map object has:
  - `i_map` (int): Unique identifier of the map.
  - `x_nm_map` (str): Name of the map.
  - `i_typ_zn` (int): The highest-priority zone type associated with the map (e.g., 1 for campus, 2 for building).

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/get_maps_with_zone_types" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "maps": [
    {
      "i_map": 101,
      "x_nm_map": "Main Campus Map",
      "i_typ_zn": 1
    },
    {
      "i_map": 102,
      "x_nm_map": "Building A Floor 1",
      "i_typ_zn": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: A user needs to select a map in the Zone Viewer but wants to filter by zone type (e.g., campus or building).
- **Action**: The frontend calls this endpoint to populate a dropdown or list of maps, showing their names and zone types.
- **Outcome**: The user can quickly identify and select the relevant map.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Raised if no maps are found (`HTTPException`, detail="No maps found").
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- The zone type hierarchy (1=campus, 10=area, 2=building, etc.) is defined in the SQL query. Refer to the
  ParcoRTLS documentation for zone type definitions.
- Use this endpoint for map selection UI components or reporting tools.
