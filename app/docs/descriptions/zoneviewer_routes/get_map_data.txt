Retrieve map data including image URL and bounds for rendering.

**Description**:
This endpoint provides a convenient combination of a map’s image URL and its spatial bounds, formatted for
direct use in the ParcoRTLS Zone Viewer frontend. It is used to render maps with proper scaling and alignment
in the React app.

**Parameters**:
- `map_id` (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the map.

**Returns**:
- JSON object with the following keys:
  - `imageUrl` (str): URL to fetch the map image (points to `/get_map/{map_id}`).
  - `bounds` (list): 2D array of coordinates [[min_y, min_x], [max_y, max_x]] defining the map’s extent.

**Example Usage**:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/get_map_data/101" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "http://192.168.210.226:8000/zoneviewer/get_map/101",
  "bounds": [
    [0.0, 0.0],
    [50.0, 100.0]
  ]
}
```

**Use Case**:
- **Scenario**: The Zone Viewer needs to display a map with zones overlaid.
- **Action**: The React frontend calls this endpoint to get the image URL and bounds, then renders the map
  using a library like Leaflet or Canvas.
- **Outcome**: The map is displayed with correct scaling, and zones are accurately positioned.

**Errors**:
- **404 Not Found**: Raised if no map data is found for the given `map_id` (`HTTPException`, detail="No map data found for map_id={map_id}").
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Raised for database errors or unexpected failures (`HTTPException`, detail=str(e)).

**Hint**:
- This endpoint is optimized for frontend integration. Use the `imageUrl` to fetch the map image and `bounds`
  to configure the map’s coordinate system in the UI.
