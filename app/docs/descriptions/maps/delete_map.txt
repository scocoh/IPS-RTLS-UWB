Deletes a map from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes a map identified by its map_id, typically used when a map is no longer needed or was added in error.

Parameters:
- map_id (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the map to delete.

Returns:
- dict: A JSON response with a success message.
    - message (str): Confirmation that the map was deleted successfully.

Raises:
- HTTPException (404): If the specified map_id does not exist.
- HTTPException (500): If an unexpected error occurs during the database operation.

Example:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/delete_map/1"
```
Response:
```json
{"message": "Map 1 deleted successfully"}
```

Use Case:
- An administrator deletes an outdated map that is no longer relevant due to a building demolition or map replacement.

Hint:
- Ensure no zones are linked to the map before deletion, as this may cause orphaned zones. Check with `/get_campus_zones/{campus_id}`.
