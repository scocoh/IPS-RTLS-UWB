Updates metadata for a specific map in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint allows administrators to update map metadata, such as geographical bounds, to ensure accurate rendering in the frontend.

Parameters:
- request (MapUpdateRequest): The request body containing:
    - map_id (int, required): The unique identifier of the map.
    - min_x (float, required): The minimum X coordinate of the map.
    - min_y (float, required): The minimum Y coordinate of the map.
    - max_x (float, required): The maximum X coordinate of the map.
    - max_y (float, required): The maximum Y coordinate of the map.

Returns:
- dict: A JSON response with a success message.
    - message (str): Confirmation that the metadata was updated successfully.

Raises:
- HTTPException (404): If the metadata update fails (e.g., map_id not found).
- HTTPException (500): If an unexpected error occurs during the database operation.

Example:
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/update_map_metadata"          -H "Content-Type: application/json"          -d '{"map_id": 1, "min_x": 0, "min_y": 0, "max_x": 200, "max_y": 150}'
```
Response:
```json
{"message": "Map metadata updated successfully"}
```

Use Case:
- An administrator updates the bounds of a map to reflect a resized or reoriented physical layout, ensuring accurate tag positioning in the frontend.

Hint:
- Validate the coordinate values to ensure they are meaningful for the mapâ€™s physical layout.
