Retrieves metadata for a specific map in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint fetches metadata such as dimensions and scaling factors, used for configuring map rendering in the frontend or validating map properties.

Parameters:
- map_id (int, path parameter, required): The unique identifier of the map whose metadata is to be retrieved.

Returns:
- List[dict]: Metadata details as returned by the `usp_map_metadata` stored procedure, typically including dimensions and scaling factors.

Raises:
- HTTPException (404): If no metadata is found for the specified map_id.
- HTTPException (500): If an unexpected error occurs during the database operation.

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/get_map_metadata/1"
```
Response:
```json
[{"min_x": 0, "min_y": 0, "max_x": 100, "max_y": 100, ...}]
```

Use Case:
- A developer uses this endpoint to fetch map dimensions for scaling the map image correctly in the React frontend.

Hint:
- The exact metadata fields depend on the `usp_map_metadata` stored procedure. Review its definition for clarity.
