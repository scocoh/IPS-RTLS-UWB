Adds a new map to the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint allows administrators to insert a new map with a name and image into the database, typically used when onboarding new physical locations or updating map assets.

Parameters:
- request (MapAddRequest): The request body containing:
    - name (str, required): The name of the new map.
    - image (str, required): The image data or reference for the map (handled by `usp_map_insert`).

Returns:
- dict: A JSON response with a success message.
    - message (str): Confirmation that the map was added successfully.

Raises:
- HTTPException (500): If the map insertion fails or an unexpected error occurs.

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/add_map"          -H "Content-Type: application/json"          -d '{"name": "New Campus Map", "image": "base64_encoded_image_data"}'
```
Response:
```json
{"message": "Map added successfully"}
```

Use Case:
- An administrator adds a new map for a recently constructed building, enabling the ParcoRTLS system to track tags within its zones.

Hint:
- The `image` field format depends on the `usp_map_insert` stored procedure. Verify whether it expects base64-encoded data or a file path.
- Ensure the map name is unique to avoid confusion in the frontend interface.
