Retrieves a list of all maps in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint queries the database to fetch all maps stored in the `maps` table, typically used to populate a dropdown or list in the React frontend for map selection or management.

Parameters:
- None

Returns:
- List[dict]: A list of maps, each containing details such as:
    - i_map (int): The unique map identifier.
    - x_nm_map (str): The name of the map.
    - Other fields as returned by the `usp_map_list` stored procedure.

Raises:
- HTTPException (404): If no maps are found in the database.
- HTTPException (500): If an unexpected error occurs during the database operation.

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/get_maps"
```
Response:
```json
[
    {"i_map": 1, "x_nm_map": "Campus Main Building", ...},
    {"i_map": 2, "x_nm_map": "Parking Lot A", ...}
]
```

Use Case:
- A frontend developer uses this endpoint to populate a map selection menu in the ParcoRTLS interface, allowing users to choose a map for viewing zone layouts or tracking assets.
- An administrator uses this to verify all available maps before assigning them to zones.

Hint:
- The response format depends on the `usp_map_list` stored procedure. Check the stored procedure definition in the Parco database to understand the exact fields returned.
