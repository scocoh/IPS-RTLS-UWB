Updates the name of a map in the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint allows administrators to rename a map identified by its map_id. The new name is validated for non-empty content and length constraints before updating the database. It is used to maintain accurate map labels displayed in the React frontend for visualization and zone management.

Parameters:
- request (MapNameUpdateRequest): The request body containing:
    - map_id (int, required): The unique identifier of the map to update.
    - name (str, required): The new name for the map, must be non-empty and less than 100 characters.

Returns:
- dict: A JSON response with a success message.
    - message (str): Confirmation that the map name was updated successfully.

Raises:
- HTTPException (400): If the map name is empty or exceeds 100 characters.
- HTTPException (404): If the specified map_id does not exist in the database.
- HTTPException (500): If an unexpected error occurs during the database operation.

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://192.168.210.226:8000/api/update_map_name"          -H "Content-Type: application/json"          -d '{"map_id": 1, "name": "Campus Main Building"}'
```
Response:
```json
{"message": "Map name updated successfully"}
```

Use Case:
- An administrator updates the name of a map from "Building A" to "Campus Main Building" to reflect a new naming convention in the ParcoRTLS system. This ensures the map is correctly labeled in the React frontend when users view zone layouts or track tags.

Hint:
- Ensure the map_id corresponds to an existing map in the `maps` table. You can verify map IDs using the `/get_maps` endpoint.
- Map names should be descriptive to help users identify the physical location in the RTLS interface.
