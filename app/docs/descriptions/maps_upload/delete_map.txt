Delete a map from the ParcoRTLS system.

This endpoint removes a map and its associated metadata from the 'maps' table in the 'maint' schema. It is used when a map is no longer needed or was uploaded in error. Note that deleting a map may affect associated zones, regions, or triggers.

Parameters:
- map_id (int, required): The unique ID of the map to delete (path parameter).

Returns:
- JSON object with:
  - message (str): Confirmation message (e.g., "Map 123 deleted successfully").

Raises:
- HTTPException (404): If the map ID does not exist in the database.
- HTTPException (500): If the deletion fails due to database errors.

Example:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://192.168.210.226:8000/delete_map/123"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Map 123 deleted successfully"
}
```

Use Case:
- A facility manager deletes an outdated map (e.g., for a decommissioned building) to prevent it from being used in tracking operations.

Hint:
- Before deleting, check if the map is referenced by zones or regions using the `/get_map_zones/{map_id}` or `/get_map_regions/{map_id}` endpoints to avoid orphaned data.
- Ensure no active tracking operations depend on this map to prevent disruptions.
