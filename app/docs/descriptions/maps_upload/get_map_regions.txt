Retrieve the number of regions associated with a specific map.

This endpoint counts the number of regions linked to a map by joining the 'regions' and 'zones' tables in the 'maint' schema. Regions are sub-areas within zones, and this endpoint helps assess the complexity of a map's configuration.

Parameters:
- map_id (int, required): The unique ID of the map (path parameter).

Returns:
- JSON object with:
  - region_count (int): The number of regions associated with the map (0 if none).

Raises:
- HTTPException (500): If there is an error fetching region data (e.g., database connection issues).

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/get_map_regions/123"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "region_count": 10
}
```

Use Case:
- A developer checks the number of regions on a map to determine if additional configuration (e.g., triggers) is needed for fine-grained tracking within zones.

Hint:
- Regions are tied to zones, so ensure zones exist for the map (check with `/get_map_zones/{map_id}`) before expecting regions.
- A high `region_count` may indicate a complex map with detailed sub-areas, requiring careful management.
