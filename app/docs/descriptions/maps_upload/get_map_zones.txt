Retrieve the number of zones associated with a specific map.

This endpoint queries the 'zones' table in the 'maint' schema to count the number of zones linked to a given map. It is useful for understanding the scope of a map's usage in the ParcoRTLS system.

Parameters:
- map_id (int, required): The unique ID of the map (path parameter).

Returns:
- JSON object with:
  - zone_count (int): The number of zones associated with the map (0 if none).

Raises:
- None explicitly, but database errors may result in a 500 status code (handled by FastAPI).

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/get_map_zones/123"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "zone_count": 5
}
```

Use Case:
- A system administrator checks how many zones (e.g., rooms or areas) are defined for a map before updating or deleting it to assess its impact.

Hint:
- Use this endpoint before deleting a map to ensure no zones are orphaned.
- A `zone_count` of 0 indicates the map is not yet associated with any zones, which may suggest it is safe to modify or delete.
