Fetch triggers whose regions contain the specified point coordinates.

This endpoint identifies triggers whose associated regions (defined by vertices) include the given (x, y, z) point. It is used to determine which triggers a device at a specific location might activate.

Args:
    x (float): The x-coordinate of the point (query parameter, required).
    y (float): The y-coordinate of the point (query parameter, required).
    z (float): The z-coordinate of the point (query parameter, required).

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries, each containing:
        - i_trg (int): Trigger ID.
        - x_nm_trg (str): Trigger name.
        - i_dir (int): Direction ID.
        - f_ign (bool): Ignore flag.
        - i_rgn (int): Region ID.
        - n_x (float): Vertex x-coordinate.
        - n_y (float): Vertex y-coordinate.
        - n_z (float): Vertex z-coordinate.

Raises:
    HTTPException:
        - 404: If no triggers are found for the point.
        - 500: For database errors or unexpected issues.

Example:
    To fetch triggers for point (0.0, 0.0, 0.0):
    ```
    curl -X GET "http://192.168.210.226:8000/get_triggers_by_point?x=0.0&y=0.0&z=0.0"
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "i_trg": 123,
            "x_nm_trg": "EntryGate",
            "i_dir": 1,
            "f_ign": false,
            "i_rgn": 567,
            "n_x": 0.0,
            "n_y": 0.0,
            "n_z": 0.0
        }
    ]
    ```

Use Case:
    This endpoint is used to check which triggers a device at a specific location might interact with, such as determining if a tag is within a trigger region for access control or alerts.

Hint:
    - The query checks exact vertex matches, which may not always return expected results for regions. Consider using /trigger_contains_point for more accurate containment checks.
    - Ensure the point coordinates are within the systemâ€™s coordinate system (e.g., matching the units used in maint.vertices).
