Fetch zones that may contain a given point (x, y, z) based on their bounding box.

This endpoint retrieves zones whose bounding boxes (defined by regions) contain the specified
point coordinates. It supports filtering by zone type (e.g., zone_type=1 for Level 1 zones,
typically campuses). The response includes whether the point is definitively within the zone's
bounding box.

Args:
    x (float): The x-coordinate of the point.
    y (float): The y-coordinate of the point.
    z (float): The z-coordinate of the point.
    zone_type (int, optional): Filter by zone type (e.g., 1 for Level 1 zones). Defaults to 0 (no filter).

Returns:
    list: A list of dictionaries containing:
        - zone_id (int): The ID of the zone.
        - zone_name (str): The name of the zone.
        - contains (bool): True if the point is within the zone's bounding box, False otherwise.

Raises:
    HTTPException: 500 if the database query fails.

Example:
    To check if a point (x=0, y=0, z=0) is within any Level 1 zones (campuses):
    ```
    GET /api/zones_by_point?x=0&y=0&z=0&zone_type=1
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    [
        {"zone_id": 417, "zone_name": "2303251508CL1", "contains": true},
        {"zone_id": 419, "zone_name": "ib2503251653cl1", "contains": true}
    ]
    ```

Hint (Use Case):
    This endpoint can be used to answer questions like "is a tag on campus?" where the tag is identified
    by a tag number (e.g., 'TAG001') and the campus is a bounding box created with a Zone L1 associated
    with a map. To use it for this purpose:
    1. Fetch the tag's position (x, y, z) using `/api/get_recent_device_positions/{device_id}`.
    2. Call this endpoint with the tag's coordinates and `zone_type=1` to filter for Level 1 zones (campuses).
    3. Check the response to see if the specific campus (by zone_id) contains the tag.
    Example: If checking if 'TAG001' is on campus with zone_id=417, fetch its position, then call this endpoint
    and look for zone_id=417 in the response with `"contains": true`.
